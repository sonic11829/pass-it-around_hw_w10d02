1.  My understanding of how the Internet works is by making a request such as requesting to go to a certain url such as "google.com" and then a server that was created takes that request. If it is available it will give you a response by opening/showing google's homepage that was built and styled and Javascripted and/or whateverelsed by genius developers. If what is requested isn't there then the page will show an error code and list a reason for not being able to find what was requested. 

2.  -HTML is the skeleton of your webpage. You can place elements wherever you want and
    what you want to be apart of the webpage such as your heading your paragraphs your buttons, etc.

    -CSS is what you use to style your HTML or webpage, you can make the words a different size, give them a different look and make your own creations specified to certain elements of the HTML.

    -JAVASCRIPT is the functionallity for the HTML or webpage, you can create functions and different variables and objects and so much more that you can push or link to the HTML that can make different things happen whether it being a sound when button is clicked to making a new message display to so much more!

3.  My understanding was that front-end developers create websites using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other languages. Back-end developers build and maintain servers and possibly other systems to process recieved data and perform responses for the websites created by the front-end Developers.
